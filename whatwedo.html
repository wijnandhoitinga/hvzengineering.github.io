<p>Hoitinga &amp; van Zwieten (HvZ) Computational Engineering is a young
consultancy company that specializes in building computer simulations for
physical processes, by casting them into mathematical models and subsequently
solving these by numerical methods. Well designed computer simulations give valuable
understanding of many solid and fluid mechanical problems in engineering.</p>

<p>The ability to model and simulate physical processes makes HvZ a valuable
asset in the product design phase of our clients. Instead of optimizing
manufactured prototypes, HvZ aims to optimize the <em>virtual prototypes</em>,
items that exist only in the computer. This approach can lead to a substantial
cost reduction as it will ultimately lead to fewer manufactured prototypes.</p>

<p>In addition, HvZ is able to develop its own dedicated software tools during
the virtual design phase, which allows them to operate where most competition
cannot follow. HvZ can provide its clients the license-free software tools
which, if desired, enable them to play an active role in the virtual prototyping
process. An additional advantage of in-house software development is an
unmatched flexibility with regard to non-conventional design issues.</p>

<p>We remark that our consultancy services are not restricted to off site work
only. If it is more convenient to work on site, for instance to work in a team
or with specific software, we can just as well work at our clients.</p>


<h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3>

<p>HvZ specializes in the numerical modeling of problems in the physical world,
such as structural or fluid flow problems. This is typically a two-step
process, which we shall illustrate with an example. Imagine having an interest
in temperature loss of fluid flowing through a pipe, and turning to HvZ for a
numerical study.</p>

<div class="more">

<p><b>Step 1</b> is to translate the physical problem to a mathematical
description. In the case at hand we will recognize the physical problem
to be a convection diffusion problem, for which the mathematical description is
known. We will also define the boundary conditions by asking the client specific
questions about the setup. The outcome is a closed mathematical system with a
unique solution.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> is to solve the mathematical system numerically, primarily by
means of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method"
target="blank_">Finite Element modeling</a> (wikipedia). The result will generally be an
approximate solution to the mathematical problem at hand. The degree of accuracy is
configurable and is a trade-off with computation time. Design parameters such as
the diameter of the pipe will be varied as well.</p>

<p>The distinction between the two steps is important, as it allows two
potential error-components in the obtained solution. The first component is associated with
a possible mismatch between the physics and the mathematical description. For instance, if
the scale of the problem is such that molecular effects are significant but
this is not accounted for in the mathematical description, one introduces modeling errors. 
The second component is concerned with the numerical approximation,
for example by unjustly sacrificing accuracy for speed. At HvZ we are constantly
aware of these hazards, and will make sure that both error contributions are
guarded closely.</p>

<p>By combining mathematical and numerical expertise, HvZ can offer a unique,
integral approach to problem solving. We believe that a correct understanding of
the mathematical basis is vital for numerical modeling, and that this is what
sets us aparts from many competitors. HvZ stands for quality, and we
are eager to deliver it. </p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>HvZ develops dedicated software tools that can be licenced to the client at
request. These are typically specific tools for a given task, though with as
many buttons as desired for the design process. For example, the software can be
specific for computing the temperature distribution in a pipe, but may allow the
thickness and inlet temperature to vary to examine the effect.
The set of requirements and desired flexibility of the tool will be discussed at
project intake, where it is our expertise to translate a set of engineering
demands to software requirements.</p>

<div class="more">

<p>HvZ builds on a long experience of developing numerical software. As a
result, rather than writing every new program from scratch, we can reuse
components that have been developed over the years. This results in rapid
development, as typically only the problem-specific layer needs to be
implemented. Further, by building on mature components, the software will be stable
and fast. Regarding accuracy, note that we take pride in always verifying our
results against the <a href="whatwedo_modeling.html">mathematics</a>. Furthermore,
we note that at HvZ we invest in developing the latest numerical methods for best results.</p>

<p>Although we are comfortable to work with any computer language, our language
of choice is <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>, for
four primary reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The fact that it is free, which results in a significant cost benefit for
our clients.</li>
<li>Its focus on readability, which directly benefits both ourselves and our
clients.</li>
<li>Its high level nature, which allows for rapid development without low level
distractions, but with the possibility for low level optimizations where
necessary.</li>
<li>The wealth of modules, both scientific and otherwise, that are being created
and maintained by the world wide open source community.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last group is one that we at HvZ are most obliged to, and we recognize
that our work would not be possible without the hard work of others. HvZ
believes firmly in the future of open source, and would like to make its
contribution by disclosing all non-problem specific source code to benefit the
community. As yet, a lot of work still needs to be done to prepare for this
step, but a first version is expected in the third quarter of 2011. We are
excited about this and look forward to working closely with the community!</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>To get an idea on how HvZ can help with your virtual product design, consider
the following examples:</p>

<div class="more">

<ul>
<li>Engineering applications that contain <em>tribology</em> aspects. Think of
lubrication and friction, air bearings, oil bearings, and applications that
contain thin-film fluids.</li>
<li>Heat-transfer related problems, such as conditioning of system components
and dimensioning of heating/cooling systems.</li>
<li>Fluid flow related problems.</li>
<li>Deformation and stress computations of constructions (solid
mechanics).</li>
<li>Coupled problems, e.g. heat-transfer and fluid flow or fluid-structure
interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mathematical and numerical background enables HvZ to quickly understand
many other types of problems. Do not hesitate to <a
href="contact.html">contact</a> HvZ and ask whether the issues regarding your
virtual design can be addressed as well. In addition, we emphasize that HvZ is
not restricted to off site work only. If preferred, HvZ can help on site and
assist in generic design engineering tasks.</p>
