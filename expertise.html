<h3 id="multiphase">Multiphase flows, diffuse interfaces</h3>

<p>Multiphase flows is a complicated topic in computer simulation, primarily because of numerical challenges.

<h3 id="thermomechanics">Thermo-mechanics</h3>

<p>HvZ is involved in a project in which system performance of lithography tools is improved based 
on computer simulation of thermo-mechanical behaviour during an illumination process. 
A challenging project, because a derivative of Nutils may be included in existing software architecture. 
A successful implementation enables the system to execute feed-forward control based on solutions of
thermo-mechanical model equations. Although detailed information cannot be revealed, examples of other 
thermo-mechanical simulations can be found here:

<h3 id="flows">Flow problems</h3>

<p>Although flow problems may be conceived of as problems in which a fluid flows, it can be 
extended to a more general type of problems, notably, transport problems.
In this sense, heat-transfer problems and convection-diffusion type problems also classify as 
flow problems. A selection of flow problems that were computed with Nutils can be found at:
