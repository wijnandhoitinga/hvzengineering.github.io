<h3>Innecs BV</h3>

<p>In February 2011 Innecs BV contacted HvZ Computational Engineering with the
question to assist in virtual prototyping of (parts of) a gas turbine.  Within
several weeks HvZ analysed and adequately tackled the problem resulting in the
release of a stand-alone, license free Octave code, which is now used by Innecs
in their design phase. This code enables Innecs to run simulations and study gas
turbines without having to rely on third parties.</p>

<h3>ASML</h3>

<p>
ASML is the world's leading provider of lithography systems for the
semiconductor industry. ASML designs and assembles complex machines that are critical to the
production of integrated circuits or microchips. HvZ assists by modeling system components
and thereby improving virtual prototyping aspects in the design phase, in
particular, aspects related to fluid flow and heat-transfer. Because ASML has well developed 
experimental facilities, they provide a unique environment to compare numerical
experiments with measurements. For more information see <a
