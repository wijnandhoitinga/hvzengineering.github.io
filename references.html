HvZ and the group of <a href="http://www.tue.nl/universiteit/faculteiten/faculteit-werktuigbouwkunde/de-faculteit/medewerkers/detail/ep/e/d/ep-uid/20094239/">Multiscale Engineering Fluid Dynamics</a> (MEFD) of Prof.dr.ir. Van Brummelen from Eindhoven University of Technology 
form a alliance in the development of advanced software to compute complicated model problems.
Students and staff members conduct research on new numerical methods and HvZ provide a platform enabling
a quick and easy implementation of these ideas. This development of this platform is known as <a href="http://nutils.org"> the nutils project</a>
The alliance serves a mutual benefit. The MEFD research group has advanced and flexible low level software tools to their disposal including support. 
HvZ can include all latest developments in the field of physics simulation, thereby serving industry with the most advanced methods and, moreover, closing the gap between research and practical application.</p>

<h3>Innecs BV
<a href="http://www.innecs.nl" class="floatbox"><img src="/images/innecs-logo.png" width="100" alt="asml-logo"><br>www.innecs.nl</a>
</h3>

<p>In February 2011 Innecs BV contacted HvZ Computational Engineering with the
question to assist in virtual prototyping of (parts of) a gas turbine.  Within
several weeks HvZ analysed and adequately tackled the problem resulting in the
release of a stand-alone, license free Octave code, which is now used by Innecs
in their design phase. This code enables Innecs to run simulations and study
gas turbines without having to rely on third parties.</p>

<h3>Inviscid
<a href="http://www.inviscid.nl" class="floatbox"><img src="/images/inviscid-logo.png" width="100" alt="asml-logo"><br>www.inviscid.nl</a>
</h3>

<p>Inviscid is a young consultancy company specialised in product design by
employing modeling and simulation techniques. Inviscid excels in simplifying
complex problems, which are then ready to be solved using numerical methods. In
addition, Inviscid has excellent expertise in the field of systems engineering.
Inviscid and HvZ maintain a close professional relation.</p>

<h3>ASML
<a href="http://www.asml.com" class="floatbox"><img src="/images/asml-logo.png" width="100" alt="asml-logo"><br>www.asml.com</a>
</h3>

<p>ASML is the world's leading provider of lithography systems for the
semiconductor industry. ASML designs and assembles complex machines that are
critical to the production of integrated circuits or microchips. HvZ assists by
modeling system components and thereby improving virtual prototyping aspects in
the design phase, in particular, aspects related to fluid flow and
heat-transfer. Because ASML has well developed experimental facilities, they
provide a unique environment to compare numerical experiments with
measurements.</p>
