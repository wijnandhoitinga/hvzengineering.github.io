Engineering Fluid Dynamics</a> (MEFD) group of Eindhoven University of Technology, in
particular via the collaborative <a href="http://nutils.org">Nutils
project</a>. HvZ plays a dominant role in the development of this framework and
provides consultancy towards implementation of new scientific concepts. This
symbiosis enables HvZ to use the newest, most advanced techniques in the
field of computer simulation of physics, and it forms a unique bridge-position between academia and industry.</p>

<h3>ASML</h3>

<p>ASML is the world's leading provider of lithography systems for the
semiconductor industry, critical to the production of integrated circuits or
microchips. HvZ assists in its development by modeling system components in the
design phase, in particular aspects related to fluid flow, heat transfer and thermo-mechanics.
Because ASML has well developed experimental facilities, they provide a unique
platform to compare numerical experiments with measurements.</p>

<h3>Innecs BV</h3>

<p>In February 2011 Innecs BV contacted HvZ Computational Engineering with the
question to assist in virtual prototyping of (parts of) a gas turbine. HvZ
analysed the problem and released a stand-alone, license free Octave code,
which enables Innecs to run independent simulations of gas turbines. The code
is now used by Innecs in their design phase.</p>

<h3>Inviscid</h3>

<p>Inviscid is a young consultancy company specialised in product design aided
by modeling and simulation techniques. Inviscid excels in simplifying complex
physics problems such that they are ready for computer simulation. In addition, Inviscid has excellent expertise
in the field of systems engineering. Inviscid and HvZ maintain a close
professional relation.</p>
