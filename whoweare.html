title: Who we are
---

<p>The idea of starting Hoitinga &amp; van Zwieten (HvZ) Computational
Engineering started in 2010. At the time we were both PhD candidates at Delft
University of Technology in the Engineering Mechanics group of Prof. René de
Borst. The primary research topics in that group were related to modeling and
numerical methods, associated with solid and fluid mechanical problems in
engineering.</p>

<p>Over time we realized that a combined thorough knowledge of
mathematical modeling and numerical methods is rare. Meanwhile, the world of
<em>virtual prototyping</em> had been steadily gaining traction, for which both
the topics are key elements. We then decided to make the bold step, to continue
on what we like to do best, and to try and assist that ever increasing interest
in virtual prototyping.</p>

<p>In 2001 I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering and 2004 a
Master's degree in Aerodynamics. During my masters, I got familiarized with
numerical methods, in particular the <em>Least-Squares Spectral-Element
method</em> (LSQSEM). Under the supervision of <a
href="http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=553c00c0-138d-4326-939d-3e2bb9dbf1a7&amp;lang=en"
target="_blank">Marc Gerritsma</a> I studied possible improvements on the LSQSEM
method, which eventually led to the so-called <em>Direct Minimization</em>
LSQSEM. A copy of my master thesis can be found <a
href="http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/Faculteit/LR/Organisatie/Afdelingen_en_Leerstoelen/Afdeling_AEWE/Aerodynamics/Contributor_Area/Secretary/M._Sc._theses/doc/2004_1_06.pdf"
target="_blank">here</a> (pdf) and a journal paper is available <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2007.10.022" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Just having finished my masters, I began to work as a
development engineer at <a href="http://www.asml.com" target="_blank">ASML</a> in
the <em>flow and temperature</em> control group. ASML is world leader
in the field of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry, and serves
a high-tech industry with many engineering challenges. As such, ASML has been a
valuable experience in which I learned many aspects regarding a pragmatic
working attitude and experimental design validation.</p>

<p>To improve my analytical skills, in mid 2006 I decided to start a Ph.D. at the
Delft University in the Engineering Mechanics group of Prof. René de
Borst under the supervision of Prof. Harald van Brummelen. Currently, Prof. <a
href="http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/showemp.php/396" target="_blank">de Borst</a>
chairs <em>Numerical Methods in Engineering</em> and Prof.  <a
href="http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/showemp.php/8910" target="_blank">Van
Brummelen</a> chairs <em>Multiscale Engineering Fluid Dynamics</em>, both at the <a
href="http://www.tue.nl" target="_blank">Eindhoven University</a>.</p>

<p>From 2006 to 2010 I studied on how to model rarefied gas flows and, more
importantly, how to efficiently solve such models with numerical methods, in
particular by using a-posteriori error-estimation techniques and goal-adaptive
finite-element discretization. Publications of this work can be found <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.04.016" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/11503.pdf">here</a> (pdf). Modeling
rarefied gas flows remains a challenge, especially for heat-transfer problems on
very small scales. Nevertheless, my research led to a better understanding in
rarefied flow modeling and, moreover, some promising future steps that are worth
investigating.</p>

<p>With experience in both industry and academia, I have decided to provide
consultancy services on modeling and simulation to industry, yet with an eye on
academia in that the latest developments on numerical methods are used.
Together with Gertjan van Zwieten, currently working as a postdoc at the Eindhoven
University, I decided to help industry with their product design by means
of <em>virtual prototyping</em>. To this end, Gertjan and I founded
Hoitinga &amp; van Zwieten Computational Engineering.</p>

<p>I started my university education at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering of
TU Delft. After my BSc I made a switch to mathematics, again at TU Delft, where
I received my MSc degree following an internship at <a
href="http://www.habanera.nl" target="_blank">Habanera Numerical Software</a>
(recently joined with <a href="http://www.dynaflow.com"
target="_blank">Dynaflow</a>), for which I was supervised by Prof. Vuik and Dr.
Van Gijzen. The work aimed at accelerating the solution of large linear systems
originating from fluid mechanics, in particular by the application of deflation
preconditioning. More information about this work can be found <a
href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/nw/users/vuik/numanal/zwieten_eng.html"
target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently I am pursuing my PhD degree in the field of numerical methods in
engineering, under supervision of Prof. Hanssen and Prof. Gutiérrez. I expect to
defend my thesis late 2011. The project involves the numerical modeling of
tectonic fault zones, with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the
precise mechanisms behind earthquakes. The main outcome of this work is a novel
finite element description that allows for considering several different fault
geometries with very little overhead. Publications regarding this work will be
added to this page soon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I worked at <a href="http://www.hansjebrinker.com"
target="_blank">Hansje Brinker BV</a>, where I helped establish a new computing
framework for satellite monitoring of coastal defence structures. As of May 2011
I am working as a postdoc at TU Eindhoven, where I work on a project for <a
href="http://www.oce.nl">Océ</a>. My current main field of study is the Boundary
Element Method for fluid problems. This newly built up expertise, as well as the
software development involved, are expected to be highly relevant for our work
at HvZ.</p>
