In a joint meeting of Hvz, Mecal, and ASML, we discussed
methods to handle nonstandard convection-diffusion-type problems. HvZ presented
a solution method that offers a significant accuracy improvement for the
problems of interest. Mecal and HvZ now consider to combine their knowledge of
numerical approximation methods and existing simulation software, and thereby
improve their consultancy services to ASML. HvZ looks forward to this
cooperation.
