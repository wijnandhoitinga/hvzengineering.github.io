We are very happy to announce that today HvZ Computational Engineering was
officially founded. This marks the end of a rather long incubation period, in
which we have been steadily shifting things in place and laid the foundations to make
HvZ a success. Now that we can narrow our focus, expect to start seeing more
activity here in time to come.

PS. and seeing the very old news entry below, let us also celebrate that just
over 1,5 years ago Wijnand sucessfully obtained his doctorate degree! --Gertjan
