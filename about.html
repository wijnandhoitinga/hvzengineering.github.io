<p class="intro">Hoitinga & van Zwieten (HvZ) Computational Engineering is a
young consultancy company specializing in computer simulation of physical
processes; a field that is rapidly gaining interest. For good reason: when
compared to real world testing, computer simulations are almost invariably
cheaper, less time consuming, and more easily automated, and as such open the
way to formerly infeasible practices such as exhaustive parameter searches and
computer aided optimization. In close collaboration with academia, HvZ develops
the simulation tools, and helps to implement them in industry to push this
important development forward.</p>

<p>Proper simulation of physics involves a distinct set of separate expertises.
A fundamental understanding of the problem at hand is the realm of physics.
Making the translation to the appropriate model description is a problem of
mathematics, whereas setting up an algorithm to solve it is one of numerics.
Finally, implementing the algorithm efficiently moves us to computer science.
As a result, the only way that simulation results can be properly assessed for
validity is with a firm background in all the fields combined.</p>

<div class="more">

<p>Unfortunately, reality is predominantly one of separated expertise. On the
corporate axis, we have companies specializing in software development on one
end, and those licensing the black-box products for consultancy on the other.
Another sharp divide happen across physics, with some software packages
focussing heavily on solid mechanics, while others specialize exclusively in
fluid dynamics, or any other niche market. While specialization promises some
advantage of optimization, it largely precludes any form of interaction. Given
that many practical problems are inherently multi-physics in nature, the
present situation of divide-and-conquer is hampering progress, and even feeding
scepticism about the practical use of computer simulations.</p>

<p>At HvZ we believe that no two problems are identical, and they will
always require dedicated attention regarding physics, mathematics, numerical
methods and software. The way forward is integration. With a solid expertise in
all separate fields and a strong footing in academia, we envisage a closely
targeted consult resulting in a proper choice of modern numerical methods and
tailored software components, regardless the physics involved. As long as it is
a rule based system, that means it is computable.</p>

<h3 id="wayofworking">Way of working</h3>

<p>HvZ specializes in the design of tailored simulation solutions. A simulation
may describe a product manufacturing process, a production process, a
computer-assisted feedback loop, or any process that involves a modelling
component. Whatever the application, when HvZ is approached to design a
computer simulation, the consultancy roughly proceeds in the following three
steps.</p>

<div class="more">

<ol>

<li><b>Problem formulation</b></li> 

<p>At project intake we discuss the problem and establish a clear set of
questions that are to be answered by means of numerical simulation. Based on
client input, HvZ proposes a model and explains its range of applicability and
limitations in non-mathematical terms.</p>


<li><b>Implementation</b></li> 

<p>After agreeing upon the appropriate model description, HvZ will develop a
simulation on top of the open source <a href="#nutils">Nutils</a>
toolbox. Regular updates and meetings ensure a converging process towards
satisfying results.</p>

<li><b>Analysis</b></li> 

<p>The end result is a tailored software product capable of real world
simulation, which can be used for parameter studies, computer aided
optimization, or any application specific purpose. HvZ can assist in this
process or provide trainings to use this tool independently.</p>

</ol>

</div>

<h3 id="nutils">The Nutils project (software)</h3>

<a href="http://nutils.org" class="linkbox floatright"><img src="images/nutils.png"><br>nutils.org</a>

<p> HvZ builds on a long experience of developing numerical software, which in
2013 led to the establishment of the <a href="http://nutils.org">Nutils</a>
project; a collaboration between HvZ and the group of <a
href="/references.html#tue">MEFD</a> at Eindhoven University of Technology. The
project entails the development of an advanced, modern software framework for
general physics simulation. HvZ plays a dominant role in the development of
this software and provides consultancy regarding implementation issues. Providing an
open test bed for academia, this symbiosis ensures HvZ a cutting edge in
latest, most advanced techniques in the field of computer simulation of
physics.</p>

<div class="more">

<p>Nutils is developed exclusively using open source tools, in particular the
<a href="http://python.org">Python</a> programming language, along with its
wealth of modules, both scientific and otherwise, that are being created and
maintained by the world wide open source community. It is a group that we at
HvZ are much obliged to, and we recognize that our work would not be possible
without the hard work of others. HvZ believes firmly in the future of open
source, and hopes to make its contribution by disclosing all non-problem
specific source code to benefit the community.</p>

<p>Software that is developed at a client's request is by definition closed
source, and can be licenced to the client at request. Unlike Nutils itself,
these products are typically specific tools for a narrow task. The software can
for example be limited to computing the temperature distribution in a pipe,
though it may allow the thickness and inlet temperature to be varied to examine
the effect. The desired flexibility of the tool is translated from engineering
demands to software requirements at project intake.</p>
